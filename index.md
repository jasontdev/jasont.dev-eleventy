I'm a long-time hobbyist turning my passion into a profession.
I use JavaScript, Java, Spring Framework and Linux to
build and deploy web applications.  
  
I'm expanding my skillset to include Google Cloud Platform, Kotlin and ReactJS. See my [blog](/blog) for updates on my progress.

I live in Brisbane, Australia.
