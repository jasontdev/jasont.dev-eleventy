Hello, welcome to my blog.  
  
I have decided to create a blog to share and document my journey
from computing hobbyist/geek to professional web developer. It will be an outlet for me to write about
the lessons I've learned, problems I've solved, both personal and technical.  
  
Hopefully the blog will also help me maintain motivation
when I look back and see my progress. Also, I can't think
of a better way to improve my plain-English writing skills.  
  
If I'm really lucky, someone out there might even learn something here.
