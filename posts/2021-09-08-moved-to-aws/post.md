Hooray, this blog is now hosted on AWS. As I am working towards
sitting for the AWS Certified Developer - Associate exam, I was
looking for a simple project to build a CI/CD pipeline around.  
  
Previously, I had been hosting this site using Google Firebase. 
While the Firebase Hosting developer experience is terrific, I 
really wanted to learn to setup my own CI/CD pipeline on AWS. I
wouldn't hesitate to use Firebase in future side projects but 
professionally, experience with AWS will be more useful.  
  
If you're seeing this post then the move was a success. I'll
have a more substantial write-up on the setup I'm using in a 
future post, as well as a tutorial on using AWS CodeBuild with
eleventy.
    
Stay tuned.
